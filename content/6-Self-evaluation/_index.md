During my internship at **[AWS CLOUD]** from **[Sept 9]** to **[Dec 30]**, I had the valuable opportunity to learn, practice, and apply my specialized knowledge in a professional real-world environment.

Together with my team, I built a CI/CD pipeline for the project **[Secure Serverless for Global Applications]**. Through this process, I significantly improved my skills in **[Python Programming, Data Analysis, Technical Report Writing, etc.]**.

Regarding work ethic, I always strived to complete assigned tasks well, strictly adhered to company regulations, and proactively collaborated with colleagues to ensure the team's overall progress.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:

| No. | Criteria | Description | Good | Fair | Average |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | **Professional knowledge & skills** | Understanding of the field, application of knowledge, proficiency with tools, work quality | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 2 | **Ability to learn** | Ability to absorb new knowledge and learn quickly | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 3 | **Proactiveness** | Taking initiative, seeking out tasks without waiting for instructions | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 4 | **Sense of responsibility** | Completing tasks on time and ensuring quality | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 5 | **Discipline** | Adhering to schedules, rules, and work processes | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 6 | **Progressive mindset** | Willingness to receive feedback and improve oneself | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 7 | **Communication** | Presenting ideas and reporting work clearly | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 8 | **Teamwork** | Working effectively with colleagues and participating in teams | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 9 | **Professional conduct** | Respecting colleagues, partners, and the work environment | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 10 | **Problem-solving skills** | Identifying problems, proposing solutions, and showing creativity | ☐ | ✅ | ☐ |
| 11 | **Contribution to project/team** | Work effectiveness, innovative ideas, recognition from the team | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |
| 12 | **Overall** | General evaluation of the entire internship period | ✅ | ☐ | ☐ |

### Highlights

Beyond completing assigned tasks, I achieved several positive results:

* **Ahead-of-schedule Completion:** Completed the module/feature **[20]** days earlier than expected with high stability.
* **Rapid Technology Adaptation:** Quickly mastered **[Gitlab]** within the short initial period of the internship, despite not having studied it deeply at university.
* **Process Improvement:** Proposed an idea to optimize the **[CI/CD]** workflow, helping to save processing time for the team.

### Needs Improvement

Although I have put in my best effort, I recognize there are areas I need to refine to become more professional:

* **Complex Problem-Solving:** I need to develop a more multi-dimensional and calm approach when facing difficult bugs or unexpected situations.
* **Professional Communication:** I aim to be more confident and concise when presenting technical ideas in professional meetings or before a group.
* **Time Management:** I need to learn how to better prioritize tasks during high-pressure phases of the project to minimize stress.

### Next Steps

Based on the lessons learned from this internship, I have built a self-development plan for the near future:

1.  **Technical Specialization:** Continue to dive deep into **[AWS Cloud services]** to understand core concepts and best coding practices.
2.  **Application to Capstone Project:** Apply professional workflows (such as Agile/Scrum) and source code management standards learned at the company to my upcoming Graduation Thesis.
3.  **Language Proficiency:** Improve my ability to read professional English documentation to update myself with the latest technology trends quickly.
