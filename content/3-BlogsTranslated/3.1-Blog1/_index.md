![](/images/profile.png)

> **Introduction**\
> The future of the Internet of Things (IoT) is a subject of constant discussion and speculation. With the implications for IoT hyperscalers, vendors, and customers, the landscape is shifting rapidly. To shed some light on this topic, I sat down with Yasser Alsaied, Vice President of IoT at Amazon Web Services (AWS). In this blog, we explore Yasser’s perspectives on the future of IoT technology, strategy, industry evolution, and how these factors will impact the IoT ecosystem.

### **Yasser, thank you for agreeing to share your insights with us today. Could you start by telling us a bit about your role at AWS and your experience in the IoT space?**

In total, I have about 32 years of experience in the technology and IoT industry. I joined AWS in 2021 as the Vice President of IoT. I lead the AWS IoT business, covering Robotics, Industrial, Automotive, Consumer, Public Sector, and Commercial segments. Our services are among the most highly connected IoT services globally and continue to grow in the areas of digital twins, smart cities, and connected vehicles.

Before joining AWS, I worked at Qualcomm as the Vice President of IoT. During my time at Qualcomm, I held several leadership positions, including the launch of Qualcomm’s first wireless local area network (WLAN) chip for mobile phones, the Qualcomm Innovation Center, and the Code Aurora Foundation to address legal and operational issues related to open-source software releases. In my last four years at Qualcomm, I managed their IoT ecosystem and led the strategy for expanding IoT chipsets, including key technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), computer vision, drones, robotics, and 5G. Prior to Qualcomm, I developed software for military applications, working with the U.S. Space and Rocket Center, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control, and Coleman Aerospace.

### **Having been involved since the early days of IoT, what are your thoughts on the current changes in the IoT industry, and what does this mean for customers and service providers?**

As the IoT industry evolves, we continue to see very strong interest and adoption of IoT from customers. We do not anticipate IoT growth slowing down anytime soon. However, it is clear that the role of IoT hyperscalers is changing, and much of this is tied to the industry's shift toward verticalized solutions rather than providing IoT as a horizontal offering.

This shift is in the best interest of the customer because they never come to us saying "we need IoT." Instead, they come to us wanting to achieve specific business outcomes and need support in defining how they can leverage technology to monitor, control, and optimize business processes to achieve those results. What this shift entails for cloud providers and IoT software vendors is that they must place IoT within the context of distinct industry challenges by providing industry-focused solutions and partners to drive business value based on the customer's internal capabilities, IT scaling requirements, and use cases.

**How does this shift in roles affect AWS's strategy?**\
At AWS, we have adopted an industry-led approach as the "North Star" of our IoT strategy. To better serve customers, we have verticalized our IoT and AI services to optimize outcomes for each segment. For example, [[AWS IoT SiteWise]](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/?nc=sn&loc=2&dn=9) and [[AWS IoT TwinMaker]](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/?nc2=type_a) are built to support Industrial IoT customers in collecting, organizing, and analyzing industrial data, as well as creating digital twins of real-world industrial environments. [[AWS IoT FleetWise]](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-fleetwise/) supports Automotive and connected vehicle customers. We also collaborate with industry-focused partners to build solutions. Our principle is to re-architect IoT products, sales, and support to align with each industry, thereby meeting customer needs more effectively.

### **Why are vertical industry solutions and partners so important to AWS and its customers?**

Some customers, when starting with IoT, face difficulties in moving from proof of concept to production, scaling up, and integrating all the necessary services. There are too many components to combine in a workload, and customers don't care which services are included or how they are integrated. Instead, they just want industry-focused solutions that are placed within the context of specific challenges and are easy to manage, adapt, expand, and replicate.

Therefore, a key part of our IoT strategy is focusing on vertical AWS and Partner Solutions, providing ready-to-deploy code, configurations, and architectural guidance customizable for specific use cases. Our approach always starts with understanding the customer's unique vision and challenges, such as improving yield or fleet management. From there, we work backward, designing a solution tailored to their specific needs.

Using our trusted and scalable cloud platform, with over 200 services including AI, machine learning, analytics, compute, networking, and storage, we enable the building of solutions that combine all necessary elements. When something new needs to be built on this platform, we leverage our partner network to create solutions suitable for individual customers, which can also benefit other customers in the same industry. This service formula can be replicated globally, accelerating the process.

Another key initiative of ours is to continue developing and collaborating with the [[AWS Partner Network]](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/work-with-partners/?nc2=h_ql_pa_wwap_cp) (APN), because we understand that customer access to a diverse range of partners is critical to filling skill gaps, meeting scaling requirements, and specializing in vertical use cases. These are partners who can support various stages of the IoT design lifecycle. ISV partners provide pre-built software solutions that can be integrated on top of our platform and IoT services to enhance capabilities and features. When customers need customization to meet their exact requirements, they can work with a highly specialized SI to help integrate various systems and technologies into a unified solution without needing to invest in additional internal engineering resources.

**Beyond pursuing vertical solutions, what does the future of IoT at AWS look like? Where is AWS placing its big bets?**\
There has been a lot of speculation about what we will do next, and I can confirm that we remain strongly committed to continuously innovating and making it easier and more cost-effective for customers to realize IoT solutions. In the two years since I joined AWS, we have launched new specialized services such as AWS IoT FleetWise, [[AWS IoT ExpressLink]](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-expresslink/), and AWS IoT TwinMaker. Our inventory of qualified devices has grown to over [[800 partner devices]](https://partners.amazonaws.com/search/qualified-devices?page=1&redirected=true). We have announced [[price reductions]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/06/aws-iot-device-management-price-reduction-secure-tunneling/) to drive cost efficiency and deployed over [[50 IoT feature updates]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/), including the newly announced [[AWS IoT Core for Amazon Sidewalk]](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/sidewalk/), which enhances the [[integration]](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/03/aws-iot-core-deepens-integration-amazon-sidewalk/) between [[AWS IoT Core]](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-core/?nc=sn&loc=2&dn=3) and Amazon Sidewalk. We will not stop. We will continue to invest heavily in IoT because it is an integral component of how we solve customer problems and help them scale. Use cases like Industry 4.0 require data to be managed and processed at scale, in a reliable and secure manner. The data is already there, but without IoT, it is locked in isolated factories and production floors. IoT facilitates connectivity and unlocks data, making smart factories a reality. IoT is an essential part of the digitalization story – whether it's 5G, Wi-Fi 7, LPWAN, or other technologies.

Furthermore, our commitment to making IoT solutions more accessible is directly tied to our ongoing efforts to expand edge computing and hybrid cloud capabilities. By extending AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to edge locations like on-premises data centers, 5G towers, and smart factories, we can bring all the benefits of the cloud to workloads requiring low latency, local data residency, local data processing, or complex dependencies between applications. Today, AWS offers IoT services like [[AWS IoT SiteWise Edge]](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/) and [[AWS IoT Greengrass]{.underline}](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/?nc=sn&loc=2&dn=2) that act as edge gateways, making it easy to collect, process, and monitor device data on-site while bringing intelligence to edge devices. AWS is also developing functions to make deploying applications at the edge easier, shortening the time to value for customers and shifting capital expenditure (CapEx) to operating expenditure (OpEx).

**Why is IoT important to Amazon's success?**\
Many of Amazon's core business areas, such as warehousing operations, fulfillment centers, transportation, logistics, stores, and devices, are directly supported by AWS IoT services. We are also our own customer — and we are always customer-obsessed — so the service must be the best. Through our vast customer base, including Amazon, this technology is proven in reliability and scalability. We are stronger together and driven by core operational needs as well as Amazon's DNA of innovation.

For example, IoT plays a critical role in the retail logistics chain and shopping process. Globally, Amazon has over 300 fulfillment centers operated by IoT and edge devices such as over 750,000 autonomous robotic units. This scale supports 1.6 million packages passing through their fulfillment centers every day. [[Automation and robotics are a big part of this equation]](https://edition.cnn.com/videos/tv/2023/03/24/decoded-internet-of-things-show-spc-intl.cnn), and these technologies require real-time control, monitoring, and maintenance to keep Amazon's supply chain running like clockwork. With AWS IoT, Amazon can collect and process telemetry data that helps operators monitor their activities, track critical maintenance schedules, and ensure all packages are delivered on time.

Amazon also operates a large fleet of trucks for pickups across the country. previously, at many Amazon Fulfillment Centers, drivers had to wait in long lines to check in and find out which dock they were assigned to. But with AWS IoT, and specifically the specialized service [[Amazon Kinesis Video Streams]](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/video-streams/?amazon-kinesis-video-streams-resources-blog.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&amazon-kinesis-video-streams-resources-blog.sort-order=desc), we streamlined the check-in and check-out process. Now, drivers can automatically check in and see where they need to go right on their mobile app. This saved 775,000 hours for drivers and carriers across North America in 2022 alone. Additionally, Amazon has the Amazon Flex app, which coordinates field deliveries for Amazon delivery personnel. Flex sends and receives data to dozens of backend services via AWS IoT, processing up to 22,000 transactions per second to coordinate deliveries. Finally, when you shop at physical retail stores, many Amazon and third-party stores use Just Walk Out technology to skip the checkout line. To enter the store, customers can use the Amazon Shopping App, Amazon One, or a credit card, simply take the products they want, and leave, making shopping faster and more convenient. I have experienced this myself and I am very impressed with the convenience. Just Walk Out uses Kinesis Video Streams to transmit video from in-store cameras to AWS, running advanced computer vision algorithms that allow shoppers to enter the store, grab what they want, and leave.

Being our own customer also brings its own challenges. The massive scale at which Amazon operates globally means AWS IoT must support devices, telemetry data streams, and security at the same scale. Our internal deployments continue to yield new lessons that help the service become more robust, efficient, and cost-effective for customers to benefit from.

### **Which industries are benefiting from AWS IoT?**

Over the past decade, IoT has evolved from an aspirational technology to a core differentiator that businesses are using to solve problems and create value through revenue growth, operational improvements, and innovation. For consumers, we partner with many Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) with connected devices. They can quickly build secure products, connect devices, and support scalability and reliability. One example is Rachio, which uses AWS IoT to securely connect its devices to cloud applications and other devices. AWS IoT also gave [[Rachio]](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/?trk=cr_card) a seamless gateway to other AWS services, such as [[AWS Elastic Beanstalk]](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) for deploying and managing their website, web apps, and API infrastructure. Most recently, Rachio began using the Amazon Alexa Skills Kit to enable voice control for the second version of the Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller. With AWS IoT security capabilities, Rachio reduced development costs by 40% and no longer has to worry about managing availability and scalability.

In industrial and manufacturing, we partner with customers to improve process efficiency and yield, track inventory, manage operations, and safety. One example is our customer, [[Coca-Cola İçecek (CCI)]](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/coca-cola-iot-sitewise/?did=cr_card&trk=cr_card), who used AWS IoT to digitize their factory floor and production processes to create a complete digital twin solution scalable to all 26 bottling plants. Within two months, they built an advanced digital analytics solution for their line sanitation process using AWS IoT SiteWise and AWS IoT Greengrass. Through this, they improved process efficiency and environmental sustainability, allowing for savings of 20% in energy and 9% in water annually. In the public sector, smart cities, and transportation, customers are using IoT to improve operations, logistics, tactical edge support, and traffic management as well as public safety.

In commercial and smart buildings, customers are looking to improve retail experiences and enhance building sustainability. Finally, in Robotics, customers are using IoT services to collect data from robots to build new applications, optimize automation, and improve performance. For connected vehicles, IoT helps customers manage vehicle data, thereby improving machine learning models and in-cabin experiences. For example: [[WirelessCar]](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/wirelesscar-case-study/) is partnering with AWS IoT to manage their fleet at scale without managing infrastructure, allowing them to connect millions of vehicles to the cloud.

### **What IoT trends should we expect as we move into the next phase?**

I believe IoT will become a common expectation in business rather than an exception. Many businesses and industries will continue to invest in IoT because it delivers business and operational value. We continuously see new customer segments, like the retail industry, unlocking the value of IoT. Customers are trying to build a unified experience that can move easily between online and offline, leading to a convergence with mobile, social, and IoT to serve wherever and whenever they desire. We also see increasing demand for simpler IoT-focused tools. It is important to make these tools more accessible so companies can innovate and leverage them, while easily penetrating industries as the adoption of IoT technologies continues to grow. For example, tools like [[AWS IoT Core Device Advisor]](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/device-advisor.html) help developers validate IoT devices for reliable and secure connectivity with AWS. They can identify device software issues, such as inability to reconnect, and get detailed logs to troubleshoot during development and testing.

Finally, customers are expanding their sustainability initiatives, going beyond just reducing emissions to creating smart environments (e.g., cities, buildings, factories), leveraging IoT to monitor energy performance, minimize waste, and adjust facility operations based on actual usage trends. A great example of this is how Yara partnered with us to build an efficient and sustainable [[Digital Production Platform]](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/yara-aws-digitize-crop-nutrition-production-system/) (DPP) for the agriculture industry. This DPP platform is a key element in digitizing their production system across 28 production sites, 122 production units, and two mines. The DPP detects, collects, and runs deep analytics on production data related to yield, reliability, environment, safety, quality, and innovation, using AWS IoT SiteWise, AWS IoT Greengrass, AWS IoT Core, [[AWS IoT Analytics]](https://aws.amazon.com/iot-analytics/?nc=sn&loc=2&dn=7), and [[Amazon SageMaker]](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/?nc2=h_ql_prod_ml_sm). This solution helped Yara predict product quality and composition, improve utility balance at facilities, and detect when machines need repair or maintenance to maintain optimal production efficiency levels.

**Yasser, thanks again for giving us an exclusive look at the future of IoT at AWS. Clearly, AWS remains deeply invested in IoT solutions to meet the unique needs of customers, including Amazon itself.**
