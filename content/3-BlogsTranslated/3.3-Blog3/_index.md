## Visit our booth

The world’s largest industrial conference, Hannover Messe, begins on April 17, 2023 in Hannover, Germany. Once again, look for Amazon Web Services (AWS) to have a large presence at the event, but in a different location than previous years, in Hall 15 booth D74 right by the main entryway.

To get your free code to attend the event, check out our [event website page here](https://aws.amazon.com/events/hannover-messe/), or click [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/industries/aws-at-hannover-messe-a-modern-industrial-data-strategy/) to setup a 1:1 meeting with an AWS expert.

## Industrial Data Fabric (IDF)

Data is the foundation of any digital transformation effort, and having an industrial data strategy is critical to enable business teams to easily and effectively leverage that data to address a variety of use cases across an organization.

Why? Manufacturers have struggled with disconnected and siloed data sources that were not designed to work together, making it challenging to solve business problems and make informed decisions with non-homogenous data. While they might find success with a single proof of concept on a specific use-case, they often find challenges with scaling implementation to other factories, other use cases, and different teams.

AWS helps create a data management architecture that enables a scalable, unified, and integrated mechanism to harness data as an asset. We call this the **Industrial Data Fabric (IDF)**.

* **IDF Benefits:** By providing economical, secure, structured, and easy access to high quality datasets across an entire organization, business leaders can build the foundation for digital industrial transformation and operational optimization across multiple scenarios beyond a single proof-of-concept such as in quality, maintenance, material management, and process optimization.
* **IDF Solutions:** Include Open Industrial Data Architecture that enables best design practices for storage and easy accessibility of industrial data, with interoperability between AWS Services and AWS Partner Solutions so manufacturers aren’t locked into proprietary data schemas or creating more data silos in the cloud.

We implement IDF in multiple ways, with AWS Solutions, prescriptive solution guidance such as reference architectures, partner solutions like HighByte, Element, General Electric, Mendix Multi-App Platform Package, and AWS Services.

An example of Solution Guidance for Industrial Data Fabric (IDF) is the ‘Industrial Data’ AWS Well-Architected Lens with architectural guidance and best practices for AWS Services and partner solutions, enabling manufacturers to accelerate and scale the ingestion, contextualization, and action on industrial data as well as enterprise data across the entire value chain.

Check out some of the IDF solutions on the solution page at [here](https://aws.amazon.com/industrial/). Come to our booth and ask how you can leverage your valuable operational technology (OT) data.

## Connect with Partners

Speak with AWS experts at kiosks and demos to learn how cloud and AWS partner solutions help industrial companies in Engineering & Design, Smart Manufacturing, Supply Chain, Sustainability, Smart Products & Services to shorten time to market, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase revenue.

## See our solutions in action

Don’t miss the interactive demos at the booth.

* **AWS IoT Partner Device Wall:** Shows how partner devices can simplify data connectivity and accelerate digital transformation in the industry.
* **Integrated Manufacturing Value Chain:** Watch a demo illustrating how the Industrial Data Fabric is used to build a smart product (a car). From 3D CAD drawings and simulations in the Design & Engineering phase, to a smart factory demo in the Production and Asset Optimization area, and finally seeing the completed car on the track where it collects and visualizes telemetry data in real-time – you will see how AWS and partners collaborate to optimize operations.
* **Sustainability:** Dive deeper into the topic of sustainability with the Carbon Footprint solution that helps track your carbon footprint.
* **Supply Chain:** With today's trend focusing on smart supply chains, be sure to find out how the AWS Supply Chain service can simplify supply chain needs for complex manufacturing operations.

## Discover new topics in the theater area

The Theater area right in our booth will host more than 50 presentation sessions throughout the week, presented by AWS experts, AWS Partners, and customers. These sessions dive into smart manufacturing, quality management, and industrial automation, allowing you to research deeper and ask more technical questions.

Join these short presentations to learn new topics, ask questions, and connect with peers. See the detailed mini-theater schedule posted [here](https://3pspoprograms.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hannovermesse2023/4730AWS_APN-Industrial-Content-Calendar_R2.pdf) and around the AWS booth every day.
