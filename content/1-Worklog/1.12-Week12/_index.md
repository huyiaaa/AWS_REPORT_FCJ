### Week 12 Objectives (per CloudJourney roadmap)
- AI/ML foundations: Bedrock for foundation models, SageMaker for custom ML (Module 7).
- Build simple RAG app.
- Responsible AI practices.
- Capstone integration and review.

### Tasks This Week (by day)
| Day | Task | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference |
| --- | ---- | ---------- | --------------- | --------- |
| Monday | Module 7 — AI intro: Explore Bedrock models, invoke LLMs for text generation. | 24/11/2025 | 24/11/2025 | https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/ - AI/ML |
| Tuesday | Labs: Build RAG pipeline with Bedrock and Kendra for document Q&A. | 25/11/2025 | 25/11/2025 | https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/ - Module 7 Labs |
| Wednesday | Custom ML: SageMaker Studio setup, train simple model on S3 data. | 26/11/2025 | 26/11/2025 | https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/ - AI/ML |
| Thursday | Responsible AI: Bias detection with Clarify, explainability tools. | 27/11/2025 | 27/11/2025 | https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/ - Module 7 |
| Friday | Capstone: Integrate AI into data pipeline, full journey review, prepare submission. | 28/11/2025 | 28/11/2025 | https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/ - Review |

### Results & Achievements (Week 12)
- Generative AI app: Bedrock-powered chatbot querying S3 docs via RAG, accuracy >85%.  
- ML model deployed: SageMaker endpoint serving predictions, integrated with Lambda.  
- Ethical practices applied: Models audited for bias, explanations added to outputs.  
- Capstone delivered: End-to-end app combining migration, optimization, containers, data, AI.  
- 12-week journey complete: All modules covered, portfolio built, ready for FCJ Workforce.

### Issues Encountered & Mitigations
- Bedrock token limits → chunked inputs for longer queries.  
- SageMaker training costs → used spot instances for non-urgent jobs.  
- Bias in dataset → augmented training data for balance.

### Next Steps (Post-Program)
- Apply to FCJ Workforce Program.  
- Contribute to community projects.  
- Pursue AWS certifications (Solutions Architect Associate).  
- Mentor next cohort on learnings.
