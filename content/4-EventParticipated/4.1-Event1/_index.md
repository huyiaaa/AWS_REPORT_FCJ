## Lessons Learned from Vietnam Cloud Day 2025

### Large-Scale Migration and Modernization with AWS

- **Techcombank’s Challenge:** Managing the complexity of migrating mission-critical banking systems while ensuring service continuity.
- **Solution:** Adopted a phased migration strategy, leveraging AWS migration accelerators and cloud-native monitoring to minimize risks.
- **AWS Best Practice:** Start with a comprehensive readiness assessment to identify risks early and design mitigation strategies.
- **Balancing Modernization and Stability:** Combined phased migration with modernization to maintain both speed and reliability.

### Modernizing Applications with Generative AI-Powered Tools

- **Amazon Q Developer for Legacy Systems:** Automates code analysis, refactoring, test generation, and documentation for Java/.NET workloads.
- **OCB Experience:** Integrated AI to achieve faster release cycles and improved maintainability in banking apps.
- **DevSecOps Integration:** Embedded security and compliance validation directly into the development pipeline.

### Application Modernization Panel Insights

- **Financial Institutions vs. Startups:** Banks focus on compliance and stability, while startups prioritize speed and agility.
- **Common Ground:** Both seek scalability and innovation via cloud-native modernization.
- **Success Factor:** Technology is key, but organizational culture and adoption mindset drive success.
- **Ninety Eight’s Advantage:** Early modernization with cloud-native/serverless gave agility and faster innovation compared to larger organizations.

### Transforming VMware with AI-Driven Modernization

- **Reducing Downtime:** Used automation playbooks and downtime-aware patterns for smooth VMware-to-AWS migration.
- **Post-Migration Priority:** Focused on cost optimization by right-sizing and shifting to managed services.
- **Compliance:** For financial firms, compliance requirements shaped the migration roadmap, ensuring audit-ready security.

### AWS Security at Scale

- **AI for Threat Detection:** Leveraged AI-driven anomaly detection and automated incident response.
