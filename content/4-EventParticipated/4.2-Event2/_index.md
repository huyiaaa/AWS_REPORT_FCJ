# Summary Report: “AI-Driven Development Workshop – Shaping the Future of Software Development”

---

## Event Overview

**Venue:** AWS Event Hall, 26th Floor – Bitexco Tower, Ho Chi Minh City  
**Time:** 14:00 – 16:30, Friday, October 3, 2025  
**Speakers:** Mr. Toan Huynh, Ms. My Nguyen  
**Coordinators:** Diem My, Dai Truong, Dinh Nguyen  

---

## Objectives

- Introduce **AI-Driven Development (AI-DD)** and the **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)** framework.  
- Demonstrate practical use of **Amazon Q Developer** and **Kiro IDE Extension**.  
- Explore how AI improves **speed, productivity, quality, and innovation** in software development.  
- Discuss the evolving relationship between **AI and human developers** in modern software projects.  

---

## Workshop Highlights

### 1. Opening Session – “Shaping the Future of Development”
Mr. Toan Huynh opened the workshop emphasizing the paradigm shift from traditional to **AI-Orchestrated Development**.  
In this model, AI serves as a co-pilot—an orchestrator that assists in **planning, design, programming, testing, and deployment**, while developers maintain creative control and accountability.

---

### 2. Challenges in Traditional Development
Speakers pointed out limitations in current AI-assisted tools: lack of reliability, transparency, and contextual understanding.  
The **AI-Driven Development** approach resolves these issues by ensuring that **AI acts as an enabler**, not a decision-maker—augmenting rather than replacing human expertise.

---

### 3. The AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)
AI-DLC represents an evolution of development maturity across three stages:

| Level | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **AI-Assisted Development** | AI supports coding tasks such as code completion, syntax checking, and documentation. |
| **AI-Driven Development** | AI collaborates in system design, project planning, and decision support. |
| **AI-Managed Development** | AI orchestrates processes automatically with human oversight for validation. |

Within AI-DLC, AI functions as an **intelligent coordinator**, ensuring consistency while developers retain final decision-making authority.

---

### 4. Benefits of AI Integration
The session “AI in Development – Outcomes” highlighted seven major benefits:

1. **Predictability:** Better project tracking and schedule accuracy.  
2. **Velocity:** Faster time-to-market for new features.  
3. **Quality:** Reduced bugs and improved stability.  
4. **Innovation:** Enabling creative and experimental approaches.  
5. **Engagement:** Enhancing developer motivation and efficiency.  
6. **Customer Satisfaction:** Improved user experiences.  
7. **Productivity:** Shorter development cycles and increased output.

---

### 5. AI in the SDLC
Speakers analyzed how AI supports each SDLC phase:  
**Explore & Plan → Create → Test & Secure → Review & Deploy → Maintain & Modernize**.  
AI significantly shortens time in **testing, deployment, and maintenance** by automating repetitive workflows and analyzing logs intelligently.

---

### 6. Standard AI-DLC Workflow
A standard AI-DLC flow consists of four key steps:

1. **Requirement:** Product Owner collects and analyzes user needs.  
2. **Design:** Architects define structure, APIs, and processes.  
3. **Implementation:** Engineers develop and integrate code.  
4. **Deployment:** System is launched and monitored.

AI tools assist in every step—ensuring output consistency and better communication between roles.

---

### 7. Key Process Features
The “Key Workflow Features” slide described four main characteristics:

- **Role Separation:** Clear distinction between business, design, and implementation tasks.  
- **AI-Enhanced Contexts:** Each role uses AI differently (PM, Architect, Developer).  
- **Iterative Feedback Loops:** Continuous improvement between stages.  
- **Template-Driven Approach:** Standardized documentation for maintainability.

---

### 8. AI in Practice – Live Demonstrations
#### **Amazon Q Developer**
- Integrated into IDEs such as **VS Code** and **AWS Cloud9**.  
- Generates, tests, and documents code automatically.  
- Assists in **updating prompt.md**, managing CI/CD pipelines, and suggesting AWS architectures.  
- Demo showcased how AI creates **project plans, user stories, and AWS-based architecture diagrams**.

#### **Kiro IDE (Presented by Ms. My Nguyen)**
- A powerful extension for creating structured documents: *requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md*.  
- AI features include generating feature specs, defining API flows, and backend code creation.  
- Demonstration: Building a **Chat Application with authentication**, including login, registration, and token handling.

---

## Key Insights and Takeaways

- AI should be viewed as a **smart collaborator**, augmenting human work across all development phases.  
- The **AI-DLC model** standardizes workflow and enhances cross-team transparency.  
- **Amazon Q Developer** improves productivity by automating documentation and testing.  
- **Kiro IDE** demonstrates how AI can accelerate backend generation and design tasks.  
- Integrating AI into **DevSecOps** is becoming a necessity for productivity and security alignment.  
- Future developers will act as **AI orchestrators**—guiding, validating, and ethically deploying AI-driven processes.

---

## Practical Applications

- Deploy **Amazon Q Developer** to automate testing, code documentation, and CI/CD integration.  
- Utilize **Kiro IDE** to standardize specifications and reduce manual workload.  
- Conduct **AI-Driven Sprints** to measure productivity gains.  
- Implement **AI-Assisted Code Review** to enhance software quality and maintain compliance.  

> *“The workshop reaffirmed that AI is not a replacement but a catalyst for innovation—enabling developers to build smarter, faster, and more reliable systems.”*
